#Machine Learning without sklearn
-----
This repo contains the code of the mainstream algorithm of Machine Learning in the book **Machine Learning in Action** writed by *Peter Harrington*.

Here is the link to the book :[Machine Learning in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/machine-learning-in-action)

My work reger the code given in the book. You can get the original code and the data you need from abovementioned link.

-------
##Introduction
The code suits the reasearchers who want to know the detail about machine learning. It will be fine even if you only know a little about machine learning. 

If you know the mathematical derivation but not understand some details of the algorithm or can not think out how to achieve the algorithm using code, I think this can help you.

All the code do not use the sklearn. Using numpy to achieve the machine learning algorithm rather than sklearn, it will help you to understand all the details of the algorithm .

##Dependencies
All code is writen in python. To use it you will need:

* Python3.6
* Numpy
* Scipy
* Matplotlib
* Jupyter Notebook

By the way, if you want to run the code on Windows just like me, Anaconda will be great helpful.

##Algorithm
Maybe I won't achieve all the algorithm in the book.

I plan to upload the code of following algorithm soon.

- [x] KNN
- [ ] DecisionTree
- [x] Bayes
- [ ] Logistic
- [ ] SVM
